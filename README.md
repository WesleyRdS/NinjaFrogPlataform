This game was made using the godot engine in version 3.5 and is called Froog-Runner, a platform game where you have to complete all the levels in the shortest time possible.

It is based on a tutorial aimed at learning more about the engine made by a YouTuber called Cl√©cio Espindola who teaches how to program games in Godot. However, during development I made several changes and added different mechanics to the doctor who had new ideas based on what I learned during the videos, so it ended up becoming a game that maintained the genre and sprites but became something different. I hope you have fun and give me feedback about the maps and the game's difficulty so I can continue improving on this game design path.
